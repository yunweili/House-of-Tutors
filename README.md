# House-of-Tutors
A service dedicated to providing teenagers in Washington State with assistance in finding local volunteer opportunities in their area, ensuring they are able to make their desired impact. 

## <a name="_56kfpodyq5td"></a>Who are we? 
We are a group of high school students who are passionate about volunteering and particuarly community service, and have extensive histories and experiences with it. However, a problem that we commonly see with many students is just the sheer lack of resources available to them to provide them with the adequate means of finding these opportunities, and House of Tutors is aimed at eliminating this gap. Our service provides personalized volunteer opportunities for students with a wide variety of interests, this way to serve more individuals and to ensure that everybody is able to make an impact to the community while also gaining skils and experience in a cause or area of interest that they truly care about are passionate on. 

## <a name="_56kfpodyq5td"></a>How should you use our service? 

We have potential plays to expand in the future, but for the moment, we plan to only use and serve students in Washington State by providing them with a wide variety of opportunities that match with their opportunities through a database. From that database, students are able to find opportunities that align with their interests and causes and will have a direct link to sign up for that volunteer opportunity. This will provide them with a easy way of finding opportunities, as we do the hard work for them, and they are just able to use our database to find opportunities to make an impact in their community with soemthing they are passionate about and love.
